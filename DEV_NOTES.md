# Frontend Typescript Conversion

- DO NOT DELETE LOADER FUNCTION OR CALL IN SETDATA, uncomment after java route is made
- Created temporary settings.json for App.tsx to satisfy setData() in App.ts, delete file and references after settings file is in java server
- Default tsconfig generated by vite script caused module import errors in redux/store.ts, copied original tsconfig and will address later
- Ideally would like to convert reducers/ to ts
