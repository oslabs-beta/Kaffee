# Frontend Typescript Conversion

- DO NOT DELETE LOADER FUNCTION OR CALL IN SETDATA, uncomment after java route is made
- Created temporary settings.json for App.tsx to satisfy setData() in App.ts, delete file and references after settings file is in java server
- Default tsconfig generated by vite script caused module import errors in redux/store.ts, copied original tsconfig and will address later
- Ideally would like to convert reducers/ to ts

# Backend 1.1

- All Backend Methods Finished Except for Delete Log, which we can omit for now
  - /addData, /getData, /getLogFiles, /getSettings, /updateSettings
- FORMAT GET REQUESTS TO /getData LIKE THIS
  fetch("localhost:8080/getData?filename={FILENAME}.json")
- ALL POST REQUESTS TO /addData MUST BE FORMATTED EXACTLY THE SAME AND IN THE SAME ORDER (i.e. 
    req.body = { [METRIC NAME]: {
        labels: [],
        datasets: [
          {label: 'One Minute Rate', data: []},{label: 'Fifteen Minute Rate', data: []},{label: 'Five Minute Rate', data: []},{label: 'Mean Rate', data: []}
        ]
      }
    }
  )
